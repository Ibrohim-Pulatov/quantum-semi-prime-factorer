# Quantum Semi-Prime Factorer

A Python-based quantum computing project that uses a custom implementation of Shor's algorithm to factor large semi-prime numbers using the Quantum Rings backend.

## Features

- Modular exponentiation optimized for large inputs
- Custom Shorâ€™s circuit generator
- Backend support via Quantum Rings
- Period finding with classical post-processing
- Multi-threaded job execution

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/quantum-semi-prime-factorer.git
   cd quantum-semi-prime-factorer
